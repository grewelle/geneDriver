Parameter,Default,,New Name,,,,,Caption text
sAA,99,,Native Homozygote,,,,,Starting population size of native homozygote genotype (AA).  The native allele is an allele not targeted to spread in the population via gene drive.
sAB,0.000001,,Native-Target Heterozygote,,,,,Starting population size of native-target heterozygote genotype (AB).  The target allele is an allele existing in the population targeted to spread via gene drive.
sBB,0.000001,,Target Homozygote,,,,,Starting population size of target genotype (BB).
sABg,0.000001,,Native-Engineered Heterozygote,,,,,Starting population size of native-engineered heterozygote genotype (ABg).  The engineered allele is the same as the target allele equipped with the gene drive mechanism.
sBBg,0.000001,,Target-Engineered Heterozygote,,,,,Starting population size of the target-engineered heterozygote genotype (BBg).
sBgBg,1,,Engineered Homozygote,,,,,Starting population size of the engineered homozygote genotype (BgBg).  These are likely the genotypes of introduced organisms.
sig,0.5,,Self-fertilization Frequency,,,,,"The proportion of the population that reproduces via self-fertilization in a given generation.  This is not the same as the proportion of offspring produced via self-fertlization, as this value does not reflect costs associated with self-fertilization."
k,100,,Carrying Capacity,,,,,The estimated carrying capacity in the population.
r,40,,Max Reproduction,,,,,The intrinsic growth rate per generation per individual.  This is the maximum number of offspring produced without density-dependent limits on population growth.
inbr,0.7,,Inbreeding Cost,,,,,"The fecundity cost associated with inbreeding in the population, values between [0,1]."
mu,0.2,,Natural Death Rate,,,,,"The proportion of individuals that die in a generation as defined by the interval of time from birth to reproductive maturity, values between [0,1].  "
eps,0,,Migration Rate,,,,,"The proportion of individuals that emigrate from the population and are replaced by a natural outside source via immigration, values between [0,1]."
rho,0.2,,Selection Coefficient,,,,,"The selection pressure in favor of the target allele, values between [-1,1]"
beta,0.2,,Cost of Target,,,,,"The cost of maintaining the target allele in the absence of positive selection, values between [0,1].  Leave at default = 0 if the relative fitness is constant throughout the simulation."
gamma,1,,Dominance Coefficient,,,,,"The dominance of target allele B over native allele A, values between [0,1]."
xi,0.8,,Target Penetrance,,,,,"The expression of the target phenotype as a proportion of full expression, values between [0,1]."
g,0.9,,Gene Drive Efficacy,,,,,"The efficacy of the gene drive homing mechanism, values between [0,1]."
beta_g,0.1,,Gene Drive Cost,,,,,"The cost of maintaining the gene drive allele, values between [0,1]."
gens,40,,Simulated Generations,,,,,The number of generations to simulate.
